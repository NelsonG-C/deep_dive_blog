I chose Neuroscience as my second topic of my Deep Dive experiment. At university I had studied a Bachelor os Science, majoring in Neuroscience. When I finished my studies, I took a job opportunity completely outside of my field of study.

I had always loved learning about neuroscience, but had never really found a more focused area that I was interested in focusing a career around.

I also had my hesitations about doing wet lab science work, and wanted to look into more theoretical options in the field. This is the angle that I entered my Deep Dive with.

Over the week, I did the following:

- Experimented with an Online Computational Neuroscience course
- Researched into postgraduate options
- Explored new neuroscience fields online
- Worked through a neuroscience textbook
- Spoke with neuroscientists and postgrad students
- Read research papers and neuroscience articles
