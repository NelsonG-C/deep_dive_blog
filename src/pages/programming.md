This is the first week of my Deep Dive projects. I chose programming because I had gained some notable experience with it in my previous job. I had worked at a startup, and so half of my job had been centred around programming when I wasn't managing logistics.

I knew I enjoyed programming, but I wanted to spend a week completely focused on the area. Working on topics and projects of my own choosing, finding new resources, and speak to people in the industry to get a sense of what a full time job in this space would be like.

For those interested in my experience, I had about two years of prior knowledge - focused mainly on JavaScript/Typescript, HTML/CSS, NodeJS, and AWS.

Over the week, I did the following:

- Built the majority of this GatsbyJS Blog
- Completed two weeks of the CS50 course
- Spoke to several developers in the industry
- Experimented with AWS Amplify and AWS IAM
- Researched into Freelancing
- Found many great coding resources (listed below)

Great Resources I found:

- [CS50 Course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/)
- [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)
- [Software Daily](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/)
- [react-burger-menu](https://yarnpkg.com/package/react-burger-menu)
