## Exploring the fields

I decided to get a sense of the fields. It had been a while since I had spent time on learning about cellular agriculture - that is, developing animal products without using an animal in the process. I had spent most of my focus over the last couple of years on plant-based due to my job, even though I find both areas exciting and important.\
\
I started my week by delving into the resources provided by one of the major players in the space: the [Good Food Institute](https://www.gfi.org/).

I spent most of my morning reading through their student guide, and reports explaining the science behind the most recent developments.

## Research, Startups and Non-profits

I entered the week with three main ideas in mind of where I would probably find myself in this field. \
\
I was considering that experimenting with some research could be an option I would enjoy: either lab work related to cultivated meat, or social science surrounding the fields. \
\
I had loved my time working in a startup environment, where I felt I thrived even under the challenges of uncertainty. So I wanted to explore what new companies had emerged. Lastly, several non profits were proving their worth in the space. I aimed to reach out to people working there and see what types of work was available.\
\
I took my time to learn about what new organisations in these spaces existed.  I stumbled across Vow, a cultivated meat startup based in Sydney that was leading the way with developing a commercial product in the Asia Pacific region. I reached out to the Head of Engineering at the company and organised a meeting for later in the week.



## My thoughts on the day

I spent a lot of my first day in a research phase - finding out more options that I could explore for the week. As usual, I followed my curiosity, and made sure to keep my focus. I felt it was a good start to my week.
