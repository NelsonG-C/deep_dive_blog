## You never know

I was searching on LinkedIn that morning, seeing who could be worth connecting with when I noticed a story appear in my feed. An old friend who I had volunteered with a couple of years before had made a post about a new organisation she had just founded. It was Cellular Agriculture Australia.\
\
I was very excited to see this, as I thought this was a great idea for a non-profit, and I knew my friend would be well equipped to start such an organisation.\
\
I sent her a message because I wanted to learn more and soon had organised a meeting for the following day. Little did I know at the time that this would turn into a great opportunity.

## Speaking across the water

I had several meetings lined up that day as well with connections based in Los Angeles from several effective altruism and alt protein organisations. One from GFI and another from Rethink Priorities.\
\
We discussed how software could be applied to these fields, what was the state of the alternative protein space, and how my current skillset may best be utilized.  

Already it was becoming clear to me that I was linking programming to this cause area. I found these discussions a good introduction into understanding what a potential research, software or general pathway could look like in these spaces. I found out more about the experience I may need. \
\
I definitely noticed that the research path would be more challenging, due to my lack of experience so far and being several years out of university. I also noticed the faint thought of doubt about a research path though. Or at least in this way.



## My thoughts for the day

I had some great conversations. Once again, my focus was high and I could feel myself making personal breakthroughs. I also noticed the difference between the previous neuroscience week. I was more engaged, more energised.  I took note of this.
