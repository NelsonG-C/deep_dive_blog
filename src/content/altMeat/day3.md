## A less productive day

Despite my wishes to be productive all the time, I found my third day challenging. I could feel m motivation had taken a dip. Not specifically about the week, but from the experiment. I was putting in intense days of focus, and pushing myself to explore unknown areas. I enjoyed this but day in day out without a break was catching up with me. I ended up starting my day late and taking it easy over the next few hours.\
\
I signed up for a Slack community channel through GFI and followed many alternative protein pages on LinkedIn. Months later I am glad I spent time to do this, as my LinkedIn acts as a reliable source of news for the space.

I worked my way through an extensive resource provided by scientists [Elliot Swartz on cultivated meat production](https://elliot-swartz.squarespace.com/cellbasedmeat/cleanmeat301). It is easily the most comprehensive public available document I have read on the science of cultivated meat.

## Addressing a problem

One random challenge I spent time on that afternoon was to look at the more widely known problems to solve involving plant based and cultivated meat, and see if I could brainstorm anything for one of them.\
\
This may seem like a futile task, or perhaps a poor use of time. But I found it quite helpful as it pushed me to think analytically about the fields. I became more open to information and to questioning what I was reading. To notice discrepancies. While the challenge did not lead to anything, it did help me brainstorm and extend myself.

## My thoughts for the day

Slower, tired and less motivated. That was all I felt by the end. I made sure to take the night off and detach from the deep dive until the next morning.
