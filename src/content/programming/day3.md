# Starting my blog site

Today I moved on from the tutorial and began to work on the blog site structure and layout. One part of Gatsby that I was initially not used to was the feature of being able to programmatically.

In Gatsby, your sites layout is inferred by GraphQL through the nodes and a schema is developed, which allows querying to happen.

I set up some functions to handle the specific pathing names I wanted based off the file names. Then I set up the createPages function to create these pagesby using the graphql query of these nodes. GraphQL is truly a powerful tool to have, albeit more complicated to grasp at the beginning. Luckily I had used this in my previous job.

I managed to work through a significant chunk of the website structure, and started on implementing the gatsby provided routing solutions.

# Those Burger Menus

Anyone who has had experience with building websites knows about the "fun" of building a beautiful burger menu. Luckily, I found this great Yarn package [react-burger-menu](https://yarnpkg.com/package/react-burger-menu) that is excellent to use.

# Life Happens Too

I spent less time working on my Deep Dive today as I had some family time instead. As I mentioned, being extremely hard on myself about scheduling and the amount of hours was not the point of this experiment. I found that accepting breaks and time for other priorities strengthened my learning at other times.

# My thoughts on the day

I noticed I was less engaged in being curious on this day. I'm unsure what the reason for this was, perhaps because I was so invested in the Gatsby blog task. Overall though I was once again happy with the progress, and really enjoying what I was working through.
