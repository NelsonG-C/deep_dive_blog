# You gotta have style

After a late morning start, I got into styling my blog. Granted, on reflection this was not the best task to take on at this point of the development stage. I also didn't focus enough on mobile first development, a lesson that quickly caught up with me. Regardless, I powered through with some HTML/CSS setup, a little rusty from some time away from the front end styling.

# Learning about experience

I spoke to some people on my LinkedIn about software development and their experiences in the space. I found their stories helped ground me in the reality of what this work would be like full time. Noted, I had experienced this before at times in my previous job. However, I wore so many different hats at the startup that I doubted it would be exactly the same unless I joined another startup like it. One major benefit I also found from how I was structuring my deep dives was getting that little taste of what a week in the life of a software developer would be like. Granted, I was doing different tasks, but the intensity and focus was there.

# Back to Basics

I started reading the book [Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) as I wanted to refresh my mind on the core fundamentals of the language. Since then, this book has been very helpful. I highly suggest reading, and even better it's free online!

# My thoughts on the day

Aside from my conversations and styling work, I did odd tasks here and there. In general I felt myself waning a little on focus. But it was a good end to a successful week. I knew that by the end of that Friday, my Deep Dive experiments were onto something.
