# Where to start?

The ultimate question when I began was, where to begin? The weekend before I had written out some rough ideas of ideas I wanted to explore.
Since my week was programming, I decided that my first course of action was to start a project. To dive into a new challenge, and build a site that I'd never tried before.
This turned out to be the birth of this blog.

# The First Project: Gatbsy Blog

Gatsby was a framework that I had heard about many times in the developer ecosystem. It was growing in popularity, people were touting its speed and usability. I had never built a blog before and so I took on the challenge.

As with most programming endeavours I start on, the first point of call is to find a great tutorial. For Gatsby, I found the official documentation was well written and easily to follow (unlike many others), so I started here.

I learned about the Gatsby building blocks, using their in-built Link components, and played around with module styling. Normally I would just work using a global stylesheet. I also had my first experience with Gatsby plugins - addons to your gatsby app that provide additional functionality or modifications - using Typography.js to set a global style for my blog. I managed to work through about half of the tutoral.

As I was working my way through the tutorial, I also started to formulize the idea for this blog.

# Exploring the freelancing world

Without a job and seeking a new challenge, I decided to start looking into the freelancing space. I signed up to several sites like Upwork and Freelancer, and just spent some time looking at what the job advertisements required and how profiles were set up by successful freelancers.

I didn't end up making much headway with these sites in terms of freelancing beyond this Deep Dive week, mostly because I found other challenges and opportunities that I decided to follow. But it was worth taking the time to understand the space more

# My thoughts on the day

I've been enjoying the challenge so far. It has mostly been learning (as I expect alot of this will be). I will attempt to ramp up the project tomorrow. In general my focus was high and it was a great start.
