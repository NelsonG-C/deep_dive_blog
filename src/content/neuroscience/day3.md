# A recurring thought

I noticed a pattern of thought that kept coming back to me as I worked through my third day of the Deep Dive, and including the rest of the week.

I wondered whether science journalism was perhaps more aligned with what I wanted here than the hard science.

Even back in university, I had always loved learning about neuroscience and biology. However, the lab work itself was one of the least exciting parts. I was the person who preferred the statistics work than the pipetting.

# What I did

I continued to work through learning about neural encoding - specifically signal detection theory and the probability calculations that come along with it.

I found a few great research projects for Masters/Honours degrees that were due to run in 2021. It was peak COVID time when I was running my Deep Dive, so I was unsure how university study would pan out. Regardless, I got in contact with some people from these projects to learn about them further.

I also picked up a copy of a neuroscience textbook to help me with the foundational maths.

# My thoughts on the day

I was tired this day. I started to notice a distinct difference in my energy compared to the Programming week. I was still enjoying the learning process.
