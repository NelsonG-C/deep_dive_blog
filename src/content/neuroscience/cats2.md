# Talking to old friends

I reached out to several friends working in the neroscience space, as well as mentors from back in my university days. Not everyone got back to me but I managed to catch up with several people and learn about their experiences with Neuroscience since undergrad.

I heard a variety of opinions. Some loved the work, even though it was intense and long hours, and had decided to pursue a PhD. Another friend had actually moved into a Teaching Pathway after they found that they were not as passionate as they thought.

# A common theme

A strong theme that was flowing through the tales of those who hd continued to pursue research and work in the area was their general love of research. To explore and solve problems. To do the lab work. To write and publish research.

I took note of this for my own comparison.

# Decisions, Decisions

I stumbled upon the area of Decision Neuroscience. The research seemed fascinating, and I spent some time reading over published work and sending some emails to academics who were currently running research projects.
I also continued to work on the computational course.

# My thoughts for the day

I had an unusual and thought provoking day. My week this far had been much more exploratory than the previous, and I found I had a lot more on my mind.
