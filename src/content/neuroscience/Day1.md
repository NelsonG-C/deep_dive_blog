# Exploring Computational Neuroscience

I had an interest in delving into the world of computational neuroscience for quite some time now. It seemed like it could be the perfect combination of science, programming and theoretical work. In earlier weeks I had noticed a free course on EDX. So I decided to sign up and explore.

# A little rusty

The first hurdle I noticed was the level of maths required. I had done advanced maths before, but it had been quite some time since I extensively used these skils. I found that the first part of the course took me longer than I originally thought, as I spent more time trying to refresh my maths knowledge.

The first challenges were around focusing on neural encoding models, ways to record and then characterise brain activity spikes.

# Searching for Courses

I spent a large portion of my first day looking into the options available for further study. I was aware that if this was the career direction I chose, I would need to return to university and complete a Masters Degree.

I quickly discovered that I still met the entry requirements for nearly all courses in this field. I noted down different university options, and then started to look into specific research problems in the area to see what would catch my eye.

# My Thoughts on the Day

My first neuroscience day was challenging. I was more out of my element than I was the previous week, and I could feel it. Despite this, I was focused, and loved learning more about neuroscience again.
