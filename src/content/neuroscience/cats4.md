# More exploring, more stories

I found my old neuroscience notes and coursework and skimmed through the details I had. It is so amazing how quickly information you have forgotten can come back to you with some basic revision. I remembered the neurophysiology subjects that I did in my third year of university and how fascinating they were.

I also did some online research for some stories about people's experiences working in neuroscience. The day to day life seemed alright to me. I didn't mind the idea of potentially working long hours. I was still unsure about the intense lab work though.

At this point, I became pretty certain that I needed to get some more hands on experience with research to truly progress my understanding about that kind of research.

Unfortunately, I knew I would have to put this on hold until the situation with COVID changed.

# My thoughts for the day

I made some progress mentally and with the course I was working through. I still noticed less excitement than the previous week.
